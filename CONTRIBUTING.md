You can contribute in 2 ways - 
1. **By providing an algorithm of <em>linear search</em> in <em>any programming language</em>:**

    Inside the main directory add a folder named `<Language name>-Linear-Search`, for example `python3-Linear-Search`. If a code in that language is already present, append a number for example `python3-Linear-Search-2`. Inside the folder there should be 2 files, a `README.md` briefly explaining how to run the code and the code file. Name of the code file should be same as the folder name.

2. You can also contribute by structuring the present code in the aforementioned way.

Don't forget to write your name in the following structure in README under contributers sections: `[your_name](https://github.com/your_github_handle]`.

**NOTE: Please add your own code, do not edit others.**
