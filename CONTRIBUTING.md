You can contribute in 2 ways - 
1. **By providing an algorithm of <em>linear search</em> in <em>any programming language</em>:**

    Inside the main directory add a folder named `<Language name>-Linear-Search`, for example `python3-Linear-Search`.Inside the folder there should be 2 files, a `README.md` briefly explaining how to run the code and the code file. Name of the code file should be same as the folder name.
    Note: If a code in that language is already present, do not create a new folder, instead append a number to the file name inside the folder. For example if `python3-Linear-Search` exists the inside that folder add `python3-Linear-Search-2.py`(your file name). Add related instructions to the README file.

2. You can also contribute by structuring the present code in the aforementioned way.

Don't forget to write your name in the following structure in README under contributers sections: `|<Sl No.>|[your_name](https://github.com/your_github_handle]| <Your Institution Name> | <Your Country Name> | <Language Added> |`.

Note that, the last two fields are optional and you may leave them blank if you wish.


**NOTE: Please add your own code, do not edit others. If you think a change is necessary create an issue first.**
