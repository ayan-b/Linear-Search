method 1 (without using user prompt)
- to run the code use command "coffee filename.coffee"

method 2 (using user prompt)
- coffeescript doesn't support user input from command prompt, so to get data from user input, online ides like repl.it can be used or coffeescript code can be ran by browser. Code for this is also commented in the file.
