This is a Linear Search implementation in the Perl programming language.


>First of all, the user is asked to enter number of elements


>Then, the user is asked to enter the elements one by one


>Then user is asked to enter the element he wants to search


>Finally, the Search Algorithm searches for the element and returns the position of the element if it finds it
  (Mind it, the index starts from 0. So, normal position will be index+1)
  
>If not found, print "not found"!
