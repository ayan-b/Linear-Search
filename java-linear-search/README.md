A simple single class implementation of linear search in Java.
The user will be prompted to input the number of elements in a list, they'd like to make.
The user then will choose a target to be searched in the list.
The linear search algorithm will be automatically performed, and the index at which the 
target was found will be returned or the code will notify that it could not find the target. 
In either case, the created list will be returned as well.
